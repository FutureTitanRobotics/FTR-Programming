Learning Java




The first thing you need to need to know about Java is that the way in which you speak is called the syntax. Syntax is like grammar in Java. Some common words in Java are:




Commenting
________________
//tells the code to ignore the text for a line. If you want to make a quick comment in the code, use two slashes to indicate that.


/*tells the code to ignore the text for more than one line. If you want to say something long about the code, use a slash and a *star, then a star for each line following. To end the multi-line comment, use a star before the slash AFTER the last line. 
*/


Variables
________________
static int two: 
/*variables tell the code to store something, like a number, character, or string of characters. A variable will be seen with it’s *variable type in front of it, and if the variable will change or not. for example, static String hi. That will tell the code that *we want to store a word or a string of words and that we don’t want it to change. The container we’re storing it in is called hi. *There are different types of variables: int, float, double, and String. int means you want to store a whole or negative number, *float is any number with a decimal, a double is the same as a float, but a double can store up to 15 digits, and finally, a String *is any combination of letters. 
*/

char and boolean variables: //a char is any one letter that you want to store, and a boolean stores either true or false.




Math
________________


/*Math is probably one of the most important things you need to know how to do in java. The math symbols we use when writing can be *different in java. When you may write +,-,x,÷,≠, and =, java doesn’t write like you. The java symbols in order of add, subtract, *multiply, divide, does not equal and equal are: +,-,*,/,!=, and =. So if you wanted a variable to be divided by two and then see *if it’s not zero, you would say 
*/

General Programming
________________
if(2+2=4) {
/*When writing code in java, you need to have parenthesis next to it for math or variables. You can leave these empty if you want. *To make the code into a function that does something, you make brackets. If you're doing something like changing a variable to *"hi", you would put a semicolon to tell the code that you're ending a line. DO NOT FORGET THE SEMICOLONS!!!! Semicolons are super *important and your code will not work if you forget one. If I need to change a variable called hi to 3, I would simply type
*/

constant int hi;
hi = 3;

//Notice how I used a semicolon to tell the computer my statement was over.
}

Normal Code

There is a java code I put up as an example that uses the basics of what I showed you here, as well as what you learned after watching the videos.
